      <p class="content">
        My name is <strong>Jacob Sioson Carbonell</strong>. I am currently a 19
        year-old Filipino college student living in Parañaque. Looking back at
        my childhood, I can’t seem to remember a time when I was ever sad. My
        parents have always told me that when I was young, I was very hyper. It
        was true, I was always the loudest in the house when I played and messed
        around. I had a lot of toys gifted to me by my aunt that I would play
        with every day. My favorite toy is <b>LEGO</b>. I remember building
        random structures instead of following the guides and spending hours
        finding the pieces that I needed. I didn’t have access to the internet
        at a young age. They were against it because they believed it would
        affect my development. We had a family computer but they put a password
        on it so I couldn’t use it. The only time I remember I used a computer
        was when I played <i>snail Bob</i> online with my father. During my
        elementary school days in St. John Paul II Academy, I don’t remember
        doing a lot of schoolworks at all. I was a very social person, so
        instead of studying I spent most of the time hanging out with my
        friends. This was the reason why I was put into tutoring for multiple
        subjects by my parents. My favorite subject back then was Christian
        Living because it was the easiest and the one I was most familiar with
        since our family is religious. I met two of my closest friends during
        this time. Sometimes we would talk about our childhood memories in and
        out of school, reminiscing the fun times that we had together.

        would remember how truly happy I was.

      <h3 id="teen">Teenage Years</h3>
      <p class="content">
        I was taught to always be <strong>patient</strong> and have a
        <strong>positive</strong>
        outlook on life by my parents. They always tell me that I should always
        serve as a good example to my younger brother. This was when I realized
        it was time to grow up. I noticed that I started to have
        responsibilities, feel pressure academically, and become self-aware.
        When I was around 9<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> grade I realized
        there is more to life than just playing around, I had to be serious now.
        I started to take academics seriously in junior and senior high school.
        I disciplined myself to do my work diligently, practiced proper time
        management, and conditioned my mind and body to become more responsible,
        all while applying the principles I learned at home. I did not become a
        top student by doing all of these, in fact, I am just average, but I
        know that these qualities will help me in the long run. I met new
        friends during this time, and through this process
        <strong>I learned more about myself</strong>. In contrast to my loud and
        hyper childhood self, I realized I am actually a quiet and introverted
        person. I also found out I like to play musical instruments such as
        piano and guitar, and found new hobbies such as drawing, coding, playing
        video games, cycling, and going to the gym. I experimented with a lot of
        things to find my interests. I tried all the clubs in school, watched
        different TV shows and movies genres, and played all kinds of sports
        such as basketball, table tennis, and badminton. In doing this I found
        out I like playing basketball, watching sitcoms and anime, and cooking,
        so I joined the cooking club in my school. Being a teenager, I was not
        exempted from puberty. It was kind of a difficult time for me because
        this was the only time I felt a strong feeling of <s>insecurity</s>.
        When people told me I looked and sounded different, I felt embarrassed
        and didn’t want to show myself to anyone. I felt really confused and
        unsafe, but thankfully my parents helped and supported me throughout
        these times. Overall, my teenage years are an
        <strong>integral</strong> part of my life. This is when I started
        exploring different things and
        <u><strong>finding myself in the process</strong></u>

      <h3 id="college">College Years</h3>
      <p class="content">
        After senior high school, it was time to apply for college. I applied to
        three universities, <b>Far Eastern University Alabang</b>,
        <b>Polytechnic University of the Philippines</b>, and
        <b>University of the East Manila</b>. I remember studying for the
        entrance exams for sleepless nights, living off of coffee. After finding
        out that I passed all of them, I remembered being so happy it paid off.
        When I began studying in
        <b><abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr></b> <sub>Manila</sub>,
        I was overwhelmed by how different it is to my previous school. The
        culture of this university is deeper and more diverse, the campus is
        bigger, and there are way more students. The learning environment in
        college is also different compared to what I was used to. I realized
        that I am not studying to excel in my grades anymore, I study to
        <u><strong>survive</strong></u> There are times when it gets really
        exhausting and stressful, but I just try my best to remind myself that
        as long as I do my best, everything will be fine. The overwhelming
        amount of work is an opportunity for me to improve my time and stress
        management. I realized that I have to adjust for a while. In my first
        two weeks, I found my circle of friends, and I am happy that I am still
        with them now. College wouldn’t be complete without them because they
        serve as my support group. To not get burned out, I try to balance my
        academic and personal life. However, I still struggle sometimes because
        I don’t know how to do it properly. Overall, college has been a fun ride
        so far. There are times where I feel lost and overwhelmed, but I know
        that everything I experience here has a <em>purpose</em>. It was never
        going to be an easy journey in the first place. Computer science has
        thrown different kinds of challenges at me, and I know it will continue
        to do so in the next 2 years. I just hope that by then,
        <strong>
          <em>I will face it as a more well-rounded individual</em></strong
        >.
