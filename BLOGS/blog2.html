      <h2 class="subheading">How do you cope?</h2>
      <p>
        What helps you cope? Is it eating food, window shopping, praying to God,
        or spending time with other people? Everyone has their own way of
        dealing with stress, pain, or overwhelming emotions. Some deal with it
        in silence, while some go out to exercise, party, or travel to distract
        themselves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you ask me, I would say <b>music</b>.
        <i><b>“Where words fail, music speaks”</b></i> is a quote by Hans
        Christian Andersen that I always keep in mind during times of stress and
        difficulty. It heals and comforts me, whatever the problem might be.
        Don’t you agree that music really has a special ability to
        <b>express our deepest emotions that cannot be described with words?</b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="subheading">
        The Power of Music <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i>
      </h2>
      <p>
        My love for music started at a young age. I was exposed to many kinds of
        musical instruments by my uncle who is a musician. He taught me how to
        play the violin, guitar, and piano, and helped build my foundation in
        music theory by teaching me how to sight read and understand musical
        notation. Over time, I realized that
        <b>I enjoyed playing the guitar more</b>, so with my uncle’s help, I
        continued to practice and improve my abilities in fingerpicking and
        sight-reading. This is the time when my love for music truly grew. I
        realized that listening to music is one thing, but playing the
        instruments that create it is a far more engaging experience, and I
        wouldn’t trade that satisfaction for anything else.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My favorite genre of music is <b>alternative indie.</b> I don’t know
        exactly when I started liking this type of music, but I knew it stuck
        with me the first time I listened to it. This genre seems to focus more
        on creativity, where solo and growing artists have the freedom to
        experiment and express themselves openly. Because of this, many of their
        songs explore deeper and more personal topics. When I listen to them, it
        feels like the artists understand emotions that are difficult for me to
        explain through words. <b>Their music really feels like a warm hug</b>,
        it is comforting, reassuring, and familiar, and it helps me cope with my
        everyday problems because I feel understood. It digs into my deep
        emotions and turns them into something I can easily express without
        having to describe it in words.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, music isn’t just a hobby for me anymore, it has become
        <b>a safe space</b>. When I feel overwhelmed with stress, I play the
        piano. I can play many kinds of pieces, but I could play the same piece
        over and over again and I won’t even get tired. There comes a point when
        my hands would just do its thing while I reach into a state of flow
        where I could think of something entirely different. It might be funny,
        but it really does calm me down and helps me reflect. No matter how big
        or small the problem might be, when I listen or play music, it just
        takes them off.

          >The satisfaction that I get might be temporary, but that is all I
          need to keep myself together.</b

      <h2 class="subheading">Your friend in need</h2>
      <p>
        Music became more than just something I enjoy listening to.
        <b>It is a source of comfort during difficult moments</b> and a safe
        space where I feel understood. I consider myself lucky to have been able
        to learn and appreciate music at a young age. In both listening to music
        and playing it, I have found a way to manage my stress, reflect on my
        emotions, and remind myself that I am not alone because I know people
        out there understand the way I feel. Even on days where nothing feels
        right or something heavy just won’t go away, music is always there to
        lift my spirit up, calm my mind, and remind me that it isn’t so bad
        after all. I hope that music helps you the way it helps me, whether it’s
        playing or listening, or even singing.
        <b>It’s always there when you need it.</b>
