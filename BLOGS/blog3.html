      <h2 class="subheading">Will I just code?</h2>
      <p>
        Many believe that software engineering is only a process of coding in
        front of a computer screen. But that is not really the case. I believe
        that it takes more than just being great in programming to be a good
        software engineer. It’s not always about looking for solutions to
        complex problems or finding what technologies are best fit for the job,
        because most of the time, you will be put in situations that feel
        outside your comfort zone. Therefore, to thrive in this field, you need
        to be familiar with your <b>creative</b> or <b>interpersonal skills.</b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Personally, I always ask myself if I am fit to become a software
        developer in the future. It’s a dream of mine to work and collaborate
        with other people who have the same goals as I do, but sometimes I
        question if I really have what it takes to do it. I thought that I just
        needed to be good at coding, but I was wrong. When I saw that even the
        best get laid off or couldn’t get a job, I realized that even if I have
        great technical skills, it won’t guarantee success, there is more to it
        than that. I felt discouraged and a little hopeless at first, but I knew
        that there are things that I should do to work on myself as an aspiring
        developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="subheading">
        Soft Skills in Software Engineering <i class="fa-solid fa-person"></i>
      </h2>
      <p>
        A developer’s technical skills are important, because it serves as the
        foundation for everything else in the tech field. Without it, why even
        bother in becoming a software developer? But as I said earlier, it isn’t
        the determining factor of success. Developers not only code, they also
        <b>interact with others.</b> After researching the process of how
        software is developed, I was surprised to see that
        <b
          >the implementation or coding phase is just the tip of the iceberg.</b
        >
        Underneath it involves the usage of my interpersonal and creative skills
        for the designing of the software. During these processes I must
        communicate with other developers and designers well.
        <b>Communication is important</b> because you will collaborate with
        other people with the goal to ensure that all of you meet the
        requirements and standards of your client or boss.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Before writing code, software developers must understand user needs
        first. This means that they must identify what problem should be solved
        in the first place. This will involve me communicating with others to
        identify what requirements must be met, and turning them into clear
        solutions. I realized that this isn’t as straightforward as I thought it
        would be because given the time constraint, I must also make trade-offs
        to balance between time and quality.
        <b>It is important to know when to say “no”</b> during these situations
        because the more features you implement, the more the software is prone
        to failure. The skills that I need during these processes will involve
        critical thinking and empathy, not just technical knowledge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Even during the implementation phase,
        <b>software is rarely built alone.</b> Developers must work with teams,
        review each other’s code, and explain technical concepts to
        non-technical people in a way that is easy to understand. This made me
        realize that to be a great software developer, you must value teamwork
        and lower your pride. Values that affect your relationship with others
        are just as important as intelligence. At the same time, I must consider
        that the tech industry constantly evolves which means that I must also
        be willing to learn and adapt to new technologies. I learned that
        success in software engineering depends more on persistence and one’s
        willingness to grow than on knowing everything from the start.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="subheading">What now?</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Software engineering is not just about coding</b>, but about solving
        problems in general. Writing code is just the tip of the iceberg, it is
        only one part of what makes a developer successful. The ability to
        communicate effectively, work well with others in a team, thinking
        creatively in designing, and adapting to constant change plays an equal
        role. I realized that the doubts and fear that I feel is an unavoidable
        part of my growth, not signs of failure, because it helps me in
        determining what I must do to improve on myself continuously, rather
        than being ignorant, building fake confidence that stops growth.
        Software developers always adjust, they never stop learning, and they
        continuously condition themselves to adapt to new environments. As an
        aspiring software developer, I now see that it’s not all about the
        knowledge that I possess, but the <b>character I continue to build.</b>
